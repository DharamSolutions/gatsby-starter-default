Gatsby starter scaffolding template for your project.

We are using gatsby to generate static site from dynamic content.

### Getting start instruction...

1. `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
2. `npm install`
3. `gatsby develop`
4. Open `localhost:8000` in browser to see the website, Gatsby will start a hot-reloading dev env so you don't need to refresh on every change.
